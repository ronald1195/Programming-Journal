Description: 	This is a personal tutorial documentation on how to get started with Python. 
              This documentation will walk you throught installations to simple programs you 
              can run in your own computer to learn how to use Python. 

              I'm learning Python with you and you might find some bugs and problems with 
              this documentation but please remember, we are learning together.
              Don't be a jerk!

# This is a small tutorial I put together for whomever wants to get started with Python and has 
# no previous experience in programming and has no idea where to start. I use a MacBook so this is 
# a Mac-specific tutorial
```

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Installations : I'm using a mac
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
# Installations
Verify if you have the software installed in your machine
* Open your terminal and type: 'python --version'. This should print something like: 'Python 2.7.13'

Macs come with a default version of Python so you might not even need to worry about this section
If you really want to install a different version of python you can follow the following steps.

- [ ] Visit python.org
- [ ] Visit the [installations page] and Download: macOS 64-bit installer
