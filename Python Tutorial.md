Description: 	This is a personal tutorial documentation on how 
              to get started with Python. This documentation
              will walk you throught installations to simple
              programs you can run in your own computer to 
              learn how to use Python. 

              I'm learning Python with you and you might find
              some bugs and problems with this documentation
              but please remember, we are learning together.
              Don't be a jerk!
